#List the top 3 most popular cars.
#The "make" field is mapped as a string. Strings are converted to the "text" type, which means they get analyzed.
#The original value isn't stored in the field data, only the analyzed and tokenized version.
#Luckily, strings also get a custom "keyword" field that is mapped as a "keyword" type. This can be used for aggregations.
